# This is an example of C # loading simple.dll

The SqlCipherLoadEx project attempted to load using sqlite-net  
It cannot function properly

-----------------------
The sqliteLoadExpansion project attempted to load using “Microsoft.Data.Sqlite”
He can work normally


---------------------------
SqlCipherLoadEx is sqlcipher project it is unable to load 'simple.dll'

but sqliteLoadExpansion can load it

I don't understand
